## Functions to read in and print out VCF files

def read_vcf(vcf_file, ref_file):
    """
    Reads in a vcf/vcf.gz file and associated
    reference sequence fasta (to which the VCF file is mapped)

    Parses mutations, insertions, and deletions and stores them in a nested dict
    with the format:
    {'reference':'AGCTCGA..A',
     'sequences': { 'seq1':{4:'A', 7:'-'}, 'seq2':{100:'C'} },
     'insertions': { 'seq1':{4:'ATT'}, 'seq3':{1:'TT', 10:'CAG'} },
     'positions': [1,4,7,10,100...] }

    Calls with heterozygous values 0/1, 0/2, etc and no-calls (./.) are
    replaced with Ns at the associated sites. 
    
    Positions are stored to correspond the location in the reference sequence
    in Python (numbering is transformed to start at 0)

    Args
    ----
    vcf_file : string
        Path to the vcf or vcf.gz file to be read in
    ref_file : string
        Path to the fasta reference file to be read in

    Returns
    --------
    compress_seq : nested dict
        Contains the following keys:

        references : string
            String of the reference sequence read from the Fasta
        sequences : nested dict
            Dict containing sequence names as keys which map to dicts
            that have position as key and the single-base mutation (or deletion)
            as values
        insertions : nested dict
            Dict in the same format as the above, which stores insertions and their
            locations. The first base of the insertion is the same as whatever is
            currently in that position (Ref if no mutation, mutation in 'sequences'
            otherwise), so the current base can be replaced by the bases held here
            without losing that base.
        positions : list
            Python list of all positions with a mutation, insertion, or deletion.

    Note on VCF Format
    -------------------
    'Insertion where there are also deletions' (special handling)
        Ex:
          REF     ALT         Seq1    Seq2
          GC      GCC,G       1/1     2/2
        Insertions formatted differently - don't know how many bp match
        the Ref (unlike simple insert below). Could be mutations, also.
        
    'Deletion'
        Ex:
          REF     ALT 
          GC      G   
        Alt does not have to be 1 bp - any length shorter than Ref.
        
    'Insertion'
        Ex:
          REF     ALT 
          A       ATT
        First base always matches Ref.

    'No indel'
        Ex:
          REF     ALT 
          A       G
